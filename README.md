# DawamGP
Graduation project at Faculty of Engineering Systems and Computers Department Al-azhar University with the title: DAWAM Platform for Everlasting documents security using blockchain technology- Waqf as an example


# Introduction
DAWAM was developed as a graduation project at 2023
The project helps storing everlasting documents in an immutable secure and teransperant way using Blockchain technology taking Waqf Documents as an Example
**The project consists of:**
+ Website
+ Web dashboard
+ Mobile App
+ Backend API
+ Database
+ Blockchain smart contracts
+ Documentation

each described in the following sections

# :rocket:Project Implementation
## 1. UI/UX
The project UI/UX was implemented using Figma and AdobeXD
+ **Website** design [Here](https://www.figma.com/proto/rn2XbvMRnISBXKrFI9wlOj?type=design&node-id=1-2&mode=design&t=xKm20U67R54EVOqW-6)
+ **Mobile app** design [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/DvlPRtmCdTLDQpH3qnOYPy/Untitled?type=design&t=xKm20U67R54EVOqW-6)
+ **Fonts** used [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jzVWJe_Qe9NV3Qub-eQWq3asgI3ltFAC?usp=drive_link)

## 2. Website
The website is used for navigating the waqfs saved on the blockcahin and searching through them 
also it provide a project discription it was developed using **ReactJS** 

You can check the website Front-End implementation [Here](https://github.com/omniaEsam/DAWAM-GP.git)

## 3. Web Dashboard
The dashboard is for the platform management it allow users to enter the documents that needs to be stored and then after the admins aproval NFTs would be created from the documents and would be stored on the Blockchain
It is also developed using **ReactJS**

You can checkout the Dashboard Front-End implementation [Here](https://github.com/mai709/dawam_dashbard.git)

## 4. Mobile App
The mobile app allow users to explore all documents stored on the platform and search through them with an advanced search facility also they could request adding their documents
The Mobile app was developed using **Kotlin** for Android OS

You can checkout the mobile development [Here](https://github.com/SalmaAhmedAl/dawam)

## 5. BackEnd
The platform backend is implemented as an **API** (Application Programming Interface) that is accessed from the website, mobile app and dashboard
The API was developed using **C# Asp.Net Core**

You can checkout the Back-End implementation [Here](https://github.com/JannaIbrahim/DawamGP-Backend.git)

## 6. Database
The database is developed using Microsoft SQL Server the tables were created using code first style

You can find database sample backup [Here]()

## 7. Blockchain
The project create **NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens) for the Documents that are stored in a decentralized storage which is IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and the NFTs are saved on the Blockchain
The **NFTs** are created using a smart contract with the **ERC721** standard
The **smart contracts** are developed using **solidity** programming language
The **Blockchain network** used is **Etherume** Blockchain

You can checkout the blockchain development [Here]()
